DELIMITER //  - Start of a stored procedure (A **stored procedure** in PL/SQL is a **named block of code** that performs a specific task and is **stored in the database** so it can be reused and executed multiple times.)

// - Indicates end of stored procedure

1. Table Creation: create a table named `AREAS` with columns for `RADIUS` and `AREA`:

CREATE TABLE AREAS(RADIUS INT, AREA FLOAT);


2. Stored Procedure: You defined a stored procedure FIND_CIRCLE_AREA that calculates the area for each radius and inserts it into the AREAS table

DROP PROCEDURE IF ALREADY EXISTS FIND_CIRCLE_AREA()  //from file

delimiter //  //from file

CREATE PROCEDURE FIND_CIRCLE_AREA()
BEGIN  //BEGIN marks the start of the procedureâ€™s main code block.
    DECLARE  R INT;
    DECLARE A FLOAT;
    SET R = 5;
    loop_LABEL: LOOP`       //Starts a labeled loop called `loop_LABEL`.
        `IF R > 9 THEN
            LEAVE loop_LABEL;
        END IF;
        SET A = 3.14 * R * R;
        INSERT INTO AREAS(RADIUS, AREA) VALUES(R, A);
        SET R = R + 1;
    END LOOP;
END;

//   //end of procedure

3. Procedure Execution: You called the procedure to perform the calculations:
delimiter ;  //After procedure creation is complete, you switch back to ; so regular SQL commands (like CALL) work as expected.
CALL FIND_CIRCLE_AREA();  

4. Results Retrieval: Finally,  retrieved the results (printed)  from the `AREAS` table:   
SELECT * FROM AREAS;
